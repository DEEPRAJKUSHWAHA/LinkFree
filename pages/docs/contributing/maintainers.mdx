## Maintainers

- Only assign issues with the label `status: ready for dev`
- Each person should only be assigned 1 open issue at a time

> `avatar` json property is included

This is no longer used, please leave an inline comment with the code sugestion to remove it - this will allow another maintainer to accept the changes and we can get the Pull Request merged without delay.

```diff
- "avatar": "http://github.com/SaraJaoude.png",

```

If you wish to make the fix yourself, you can merge to a temporary branch and fix, then create a new Pull Request.

_Note: multiple Pull Requests that need fixing can go into this temporary branch, but please make sure this branch is not open for longer than a few hours to avoid any confusion._

> Where there are typos by the author

Feel free to leave a comment highlighting these, but these errors should **not** block merging the Pull Request.

Explain when merging that the author can submit a new Pull Request correcting the typos with a link to the `Editing` profile docs https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/docs/how-to-guides/editing

---

> Where a reviewer (maintainer or not) has highlighted typos and has raised these as a “suggested change”

We should not accept and commit the suggested change as this represents changing the author's profile.

This should not block merging a Pull Request. Explain when merging that the author can submit a new Pull Request correcting the typos with a link to the `Editing` profile docs https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/docs/how-to-guides/editing

---

> Where an author has used the wrong icon, either:
>
> - non-existent icon (“Twitter” instead of “FaTwitter”)
> - or a mismatched platform icon (“FaTwitter” when the link is for instagram)

This should not block merging a Pull Request because it will fall back to the default icon. Explain when merging that the author can submit a new Pull Request correcting this and include a link to the `Editing` profile docs https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/docs/how-to-guides/editing and the icon page https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/icons

If someone has made inline suggestions, check the suggested changes are correct and feel free to `commit suggestion`, please then merge Pull Request.

---

> If the author used an alternative icon (for example, a `FaDollarSign` for their Instagram).

Please do **not** accept any suggested changes on their behalf, this should **not** block merging the Pull Request.

---

> Author has misspelt their GitHub username (including the incorrect case) and the PR has been open for over 5 days and there are no other changes requested/required

1. Create a temporary branch, update the PR to go to this temporary branch
2. Leave a comment in the original Pull Request explaining you will merge into a temporary branch and make the changes
3. Merge into your temporary branch, make the changes
4. Create a new Pull Request and merge to main

_Note: multiple Pull Requests that need fixing can go into this temporary branch, but please make sure this branch is not open for longer than a few hours to avoid any confusion._

> Json package lock fix

---

> Not having any links should not be a blocker to merging the PR (despite the name being LinkFree!)

Please suggest they add links when they are ready and make reference to the Editing Guide in Docs. Then merge the PR.

---

> Conflicts have arisen as the fork is outdated

In the first instance please ask them to resolve these and you may want to provide a link to this video that explains how: https://youtu.be/eze7Y4Rxwtc

If there is no activity by the author to resolve this (approx 5 days or more) then consider resolving the conflicts by accepting the changes in the PR
